# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, dev ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Setup Julia environment
        uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1.6.1
        
      # Build package
      - name: Run Pkg.build
        uses: julia-actions/julia-buildpkg@v1.2.0
        
        # Run tests
      - name: Run Julia package tests
        run: julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test(coverage=true)'
        
      - name: Submit coverage results to Codecov
        run: julia -e 'using Pkg; cd(Pkg.dir("DTC")); Pkg.add("Coverage"); using Coverage; Codecov.submit(Codecov.process_folder())'
